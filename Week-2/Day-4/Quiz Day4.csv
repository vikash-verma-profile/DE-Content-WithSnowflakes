Question 1,single-correct,What is the primary benefit of clustering keys in Snowflake?,2,1,0,Clustering keys optimize query performance by organizing data within micro-partitions.,Faster data loading,Improved query performance,Reduced storage cost,Automated backups
Question 2,single-correct,Which scenario is ideal for using materialized views in Snowflake?,3,1,0,Materialized views store precomputed results for frequently queried datasets.,Storing raw JSON files,Temporary staging,Frequent aggregations for faster queries,Long-term backups
Question 3,single-correct,How does Snowflake enable secure data sharing between accounts?,1,1,0,Data sharing allows direct access to live tables without copying or moving data.,By sending CSV files,By copying data manually,By using ETL pipelines,By exporting to S3
Question 4,single-correct,What is the purpose of role-based access control (RBAC) in Snowflake?,2,1,0,RBAC controls who can access databases, schemas, tables, and operations.,Manages storage costs,Controls permissions and access,Automates query execution,Schedules backups
Question 5,single-correct,Which Snowflake object tracks changes to a table for incremental processing?,4,1,0,Streams capture row-level changes (inserts, updates, deletes) for downstream tasks.,Tasks,Materialized views,Stages,Streams
Question 6,single-correct,What is the primary purpose of Snowflake Tasks?,3,1,0,Tasks automate execution of SQL statements on a schedule or after stream updates.,Manage roles,Store temporary data,Automate queries and ETL processes,Control virtual warehouses
Question 7,single-correct,What is zero-copy cloning in Snowflake used for?,2,1,0,Zero-copy cloning creates full logical copies of tables/databases without duplicating storage.,Backup snapshots,Creating dev/test environments quickly,Materialized view optimization,Streaming data ingestion
Question 8,single-correct,Which factor affects Snowflake pricing the most?,1,1,0,Virtual warehouse size and usage directly impact compute costs.,Number of tables,Number of users,Data format,Number of stages
Question 9,single-correct,How do clustering keys improve query performance?,3,1,0,By physically organizing data in micro-partitions, reducing scan costs.,By compressing data,By replicating data across warehouses,By minimizing scanned partitions,By caching queries
Question 10,single-correct,Which statement is true about materialized views?,2,1,0,Materialized views automatically maintain precomputed query results for faster access.,They are only temporary,They maintain precomputed results,They replace base tables,They store raw files externally
Question 11,single-correct,What is a key advantage of Snowflake secure data sharing?,1,1,0,It allows sharing live data without creating additional copies, ensuring efficiency and security.,Data is encrypted on S3 only,Requires manual export/import,Only works for CSV files,Requires ETL pipelines
Question 12,single-correct,Which role in Snowflake typically has full control over all objects and users?,2,1,0,The ACCOUNTADMIN role has full privileges across the account.,SYSADMIN,ACCOUNTADMIN,SECURITYADMIN,PUBLIC
Question 13,single-correct,How do Snowflake Streams and Tasks work together?,3,1,0,Streams capture changes and Tasks automate processing of those changes.,Streams replace Tasks,Tasks capture changes,Streams trigger tasks automatically,Tasks replace warehouses
Question 14,single-correct,Which use case is best suited for zero-copy cloning?,1,1,0,Developers can test changes without affecting production data or consuming extra storage.,Archiving old data,Materialized views,Streaming ingestion,Data sharing
Question 15,single-correct,Which approach helps optimize Snowflake costs?,4,1,0,Auto-suspend virtual warehouses and choosing appropriate sizes reduces compute costs.,Always use largest warehouse,Use only transient tables,Disable clustering keys,Auto-suspend and right-size warehouses
